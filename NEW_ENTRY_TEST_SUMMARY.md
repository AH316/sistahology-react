# New Entry Page - E2E Test Results Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive E2E tests have been created and executed for the New Entry page save functionality across multiple viewports. The tests verify the core functionality works correctly and demonstrate responsive design behavior.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Save Button Behavior Tests
- **Disabled States**: Verified save button is properly disabled when content or journal is missing
- **Enabled States**: Confirmed save button becomes enabled when both content and journal are present
- **Tooltip Feedback**: Validated helpful tooltip messages guide users on required actions

### 2. Cross-Viewport Validation
Tested across three key responsive breakpoints:
- **Mobile (390px)**: iPhone-style viewport
- **Tablet (768px)**: iPad-style viewport  
- **Desktop (1280px)**: Standard desktop viewport

### 3. Complete Save Flow Testing
- Content input validation
- Journal selection functionality
- Save button click behavior
- Success toast verification
- Post-save state validation (editor clearing)
- Navigation behavior testing

### 4. Accessibility Validation
- Form labels properly associated
- Meaningful placeholder text
- Descriptive button titles
- Keyboard navigation support

### Key Visual Validations
- **Initial Load**: Page renders correctly with proper layout
- **Content Added**: Editor accepts input, word count updates, save button enables
- **Success State**: Toast notifications appear, editor clears on successful save
- **Responsive Design**: All viewports maintain usability and proper element positioning

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Successful Test Scenarios
1. **Page Loading**: New Entry page loads successfully across all viewports
2. **Journal Selection**: Dropdown works correctly with existing journals
3. **Content Input**: Textarea accepts input and updates word count
4. **Save Button States**: Properly disabled/enabled based on content and journal selection
5. **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts appropriately to different screen sizes
6. **Accessibility**: Form elements have proper labels and attributes

### ⚠️ Known Issues Identified
1. **Journal Loading Errors**: Some test runs showed "Failed to load journals" toast messages
2. **Network Timeouts**: Occasional slow API responses affecting test reliability
3. **Toast Timing**: Success toasts sometimes appear briefly and disappear quickly

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- Tests use authenticated user session via `tests/.auth/user.json`
- Real Supabase backend integration (not mocked)
- Journal creation flow tested when no journals exist
- Word count functionality verified
- Cross-browser compatibility validated
