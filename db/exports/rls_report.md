# Row Level Security (RLS) Audit Report
**Generated:** 2025-08-25  
**Database:** Sistahology Journal Platform  
**Purpose:** Security audit and compliance review

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Row Level Security (RLS) implementation across the Sistahology database schema. The system implements a user-centric security model with proper data isolation between users while allowing public access to CMS content.

### Security Posture Overview
- ✅ **RLS Status:** ENABLED on all critical tables
- ✅ **User Isolation:** Strong separation between user data
- ✅ **Admin Controls:** Proper role-based access for CMS management
- ⚠️ **Areas of Attention:** Entry table has redundant user_id column that needs validation

## Table-by-Table RLS Analysis

### 1. `profiles` Table
**RLS Status:** ✅ ENABLED  
**Purpose:** User profile information storage

#### Access Matrix
| Operation | Who Can Access | Policy Type | Security Level |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| SELECT | Own profile only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| INSERT | Own profile only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| UPDATE | Own profile only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| DELETE | Own profile only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |

#### Policy Details
- **Users can view own profile**
  - `USING`: `auth.uid() = id`
  - Ensures users can only see their own profile data
  
- **Users can update own profile**
  - `USING`: `auth.uid() = id`
  - `WITH CHECK`: `auth.uid() = id`
  - Double validation prevents privilege escalation

#### Security Assessment
✅ **SECURE** - Properly implements user isolation with no cross-user data access possible.

---

### 2. `journal` Table
**RLS Status:** ✅ ENABLED  
**Purpose:** User journal metadata and organization

#### Access Matrix
| Operation | Who Can Access | Policy Type | Security Level |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| SELECT | Journal owner only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| INSERT | Authenticated users (own) | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| UPDATE | Journal owner only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| DELETE | Journal owner only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |

#### Policy Details
- **Users can view own journals**
  - `USING`: `auth.uid() = user_id`
  - Simple ownership check via user_id foreign key
  
- **Users can create own journals**
  - `WITH CHECK`: `auth.uid() = user_id`
  - Prevents creating journals for other users

#### Security Assessment
✅ **SECURE** - Clear ownership model with proper user_id validation.

---

### 3. `entry` Table
**RLS Status:** ✅ ENABLED  
**Purpose:** Journal entries content storage

#### Access Matrix
| Operation | Who Can Access | Policy Type | Security Level |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| SELECT | Entry owner OR journal owner | PERMISSIVE | ⚠️ MEDIUM |
| INSERT | Must own journal AND be authenticated | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| UPDATE | Entry owner OR journal owner | PERMISSIVE | ⚠️ MEDIUM |
| DELETE | Entry owner OR journal owner | PERMISSIVE | ⚠️ MEDIUM |

#### Policy Details
- **Complex ownership validation**
  - Direct check: `auth.uid() = user_id`
  - Journal ownership: `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM journal WHERE...)`
  - Dual validation path may indicate redundancy

#### Security Concerns
⚠️ **REDUNDANCY WARNING**: The entry table has both `user_id` and `journal_id`. Since journals already have user ownership, the `user_id` on entries creates potential inconsistency risks.

**Recommendation:** Consider removing `user_id` from entries and rely solely on journal ownership chain.

---

### 4. `pages` Table
**RLS Status:** ✅ ENABLED  
**Purpose:** CMS content for public pages

#### Access Matrix
| Operation | Who Can Access | Policy Type | Security Level |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| SELECT | Everyone (public) | PERMISSIVE | ✅ APPROPRIATE |
| INSERT | Admin role only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| UPDATE | Admin role only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |
| DELETE | Admin role only | PERMISSIVE | ✅ HIGH |

#### Policy Details
- **Public read access**
  - `USING`: `true`
  - Intentionally public for CMS content
  
- **Admin-only modifications**
  - Checks: `raw_app_meta_data->>'role' = 'admin'`
  - Validates admin role in JWT metadata

#### Security Assessment
✅ **SECURE** - Appropriate public read with admin-only write access.

---

## Security Gap Analysis

### Critical Findings
1. **No Critical Vulnerabilities Found** ✅
   - All tables have RLS enabled
   - User data properly isolated
   - No unauthorized cross-user access paths detected

### Medium Priority Observations

#### 1. Entry Table Design Pattern
**Issue:** Redundant user ownership tracking  
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Details:** The `entry` table contains both `user_id` and `journal_id`, creating potential for ownership inconsistency.

**Current Mitigation:** RLS policies check both paths, preventing security breach.

**Recommendation:**
```sql
-- Consider refactoring to remove user_id from entries
-- Rely on journal ownership chain instead
ALTER TABLE public.entry DROP COLUMN user_id;

-- Simplify RLS policy to:
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own entries via journal" ON public.entry
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.journal 
            WHERE journal.id = entry.journal_id 
            AND journal.user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

#### 2. Search Functionality Security
**Observation:** Full-text search uses GIN index on content  
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Details:** Search properly filtered through RLS, but performance may degrade with complex ownership checks.

**Recommendation:** Monitor query performance and consider materialized views for search optimization if needed.

### Low Priority Observations

#### 1. Admin Role Management
**Current Implementation:** Uses `raw_app_meta_data->>'role'`  
**Recommendation:** Consider implementing a dedicated `user_roles` table for more granular permission management in the future.

#### 2. Soft Delete Pattern
**Current Implementation:** Uses `is_archived` flag  
**Observation:** Good practice for data recovery, properly filtered in RLS.

## Compliance & Best Practices Assessment

### ✅ Implemented Best Practices
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers (USING and WITH CHECK)
3. **Fail Secure**: Default deny with explicit allow policies
4. **Audit Trail Ready**: Timestamps on all records
5. **Data Isolation**: Strong user boundary enforcement

### 🔧 Recommended Improvements
1. **Add RLS bypass for service role**: Document which operations require service role
2. **Implement audit logging**: Track security-relevant operations
3. **Add rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of write operations
4. **Regular security reviews**: Schedule quarterly RLS policy audits

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases
1. **Cross-User Access Prevention**
   ```sql
   -- Test that User A cannot see User B's journals
   -- Test that User A cannot modify User B's entries
   -- Test that search doesn't leak cross-user data
   ```

2. **Admin Boundary Testing**
   ```sql
   -- Verify non-admins cannot modify pages
   -- Verify admins cannot access user journals (unless owned)
   ```

3. **Edge Cases**
   ```sql
   -- Test behavior with NULL user_id
   -- Test cascading deletes
   -- Test concurrent access patterns
   ```

### Automated Testing Script
Use the included `VERIFY_READONLY.sql` script for comprehensive RLS testing without data modification.

## Conclusion

The Sistahology database implements a **robust and secure** RLS configuration with proper user data isolation. The system follows security best practices with only minor optimization opportunities identified. The redundant ownership tracking in the entry table should be addressed in future schema updates, but current RLS policies prevent any security issues from this design choice.

### Overall Security Rating: **8.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Complete RLS coverage
- Strong user isolation
- Proper admin controls
- No critical vulnerabilities

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Simplify entry ownership model
- Add audit logging
- Implement rate limiting

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Enable RLS on New Tables
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.new_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Policy Template for User-Owned Data
```sql
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON public.table_name
    FOR operation_type
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Test RLS Without Data Changes
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < db/VERIFY_READONLY.sql
```
