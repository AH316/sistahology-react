## Executive Summary

This audit bundle provides a comprehensive security review of the Sistahology journaling platform's database schema and Row Level Security (RLS) implementation. The audit was conducted without accessing any user data or making database modifications.

### Quick Security Score: 8.5/10 ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **ALL** user data tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ **NO** critical security vulnerabilities identified
- ✅ **PROPER** user isolation enforced across all tables
- ⚠️ **MINOR** schema optimization opportunity in entry table

---

## Audit Bundle Contents

This security audit bundle contains the following files:

### 1. [`schema.sql`](./schema.sql)
**Purpose:** Complete DDL export of database schema  
**Contents:**
- Table definitions with columns and data types
- All indexes for query optimization
- RLS policies in CREATE POLICY format
- Constraints and validations
- Triggers and functions

**Key Security Elements:**
- 4 core tables with RLS enabled
- 16 security policies defined
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE rules
- Check constraints preventing invalid data

### 2. [`rls_report.md`](./rls_report.md)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive RLS security analysis  
**Contents:**
- Table-by-table security assessment
- Access matrix for each operation
- Policy effectiveness analysis
- Security gap identification
- Compliance recommendations

**Critical Findings:**
- User isolation properly enforced
- Admin boundaries correctly implemented
- No cross-user data leakage paths
- Redundant ownership tracking in entry table (non-critical)

### 3. [`policies_catalog.md`](./policies_catalog.md)
**Purpose:** Detailed inventory of all RLS policies  
**Contents:**
- Complete policy listing by table
- USING and WITH CHECK clauses
- Policy type distribution (100% PERMISSIVE)
- Coverage analysis by operation
- Performance considerations

**Policy Coverage:**
- ✅ profiles: 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ✅ journal: 4 policies (all operations covered)
- ✅ entry: 4 policies (with complex ownership validation)
- ✅ pages: 4 policies (public read, admin write)

### 4. [`rls_status_catalog.md`](./rls_status_catalog.md)
**Purpose:** RLS enablement verification  
**Contents:**
- RLS status for each table
- Security tier classification
- Enforcement level analysis
- Monitoring queries for ongoing compliance

**Status Summary:**
- 100% RLS coverage on user data tables
- Service role bypass documented
- No unprotected sensitive data

### 5. [`schema_catalog.md`](./schema_catalog.md)
**Purpose:** Database structure documentation  
**Contents:**
- Complete table and column inventory
- Data type distribution
- Foreign key relationships
- Index coverage analysis
- Storage estimates

**Schema Highlights:**
- 4 main tables: profiles, journal, entry, pages
- 25 total columns across all tables
- 8 indexes for query optimization
- Proper FK constraints with CASCADE

---

## Security Posture Summary

### Strengths ✅
1. **Complete RLS Coverage:** All tables containing user data have RLS enabled
2. **User Isolation:** Strong boundaries preventing cross-user access
3. **Admin Controls:** Proper role-based access for CMS management
4. **Data Integrity:** Check constraints prevent invalid data entry
5. **Audit Ready:** Timestamps and proper schema for compliance

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️
1. **Schema Normalization:** Entry table has redundant user_id column
2. **Audit Logging:** No built-in audit trail for sensitive operations
3. **Rate Limiting:** No database-level rate limiting implemented
4. **Force RLS:** Not enabled for table owners (admin bypass possible)

### Critical Security Controls ✅
| Control | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Authentication | ✅ SECURE | Supabase auth.users integration |
| Authorization | ✅ SECURE | RLS policies on all tables |
| Data Isolation | ✅ SECURE | User-scoped policies enforced |
| Admin Boundaries | ✅ SECURE | Role-based page management |
| Injection Prevention | ✅ SECURE | Parameterized queries, constraints |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)
1. **Review service role key management** - Ensure never exposed to client
2. **Test RLS policies** using provided VERIFY_READONLY.sql script
3. **Document admin procedures** for pages table management

### Short-term Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. **Remove user_id from entry table** - Eliminate redundancy
2. **Add audit logging** for sensitive operations
3. **Implement rate limiting** at application layer

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority: LOW)
1. **Consider FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY** for stricter controls
2. **Add monitoring dashboards** for RLS policy violations
3. **Implement data retention policies** for compliance

## Testing & Verification

### Automated Testing Available
The repository includes comprehensive RLS verification scripts:

1. **`VERIFY_READONLY.sql`** - Non-destructive RLS testing
   - Tests user isolation
   - Verifies admin boundaries
   - Checks search security
   - Validates cross-user prevention

2. **`VERIFY.sql`** - Full RLS verification suite
   - More comprehensive testing
   - May modify test data

### Manual Verification Steps
```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT tablename, 
       CASE WHEN relrowsecurity THEN 'ENABLED' ELSE 'DISABLED' END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables pt
JOIN pg_class pc ON pc.relname = pt.tablename
WHERE pt.schemaname = 'public';

-- Count policies per table
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename;

-- Verify no unprotected tables
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT tablename FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  );
```

## Compliance Notes

### Data Protection Compliance
- ✅ **User Consent:** Data isolated by user
- ✅ **Right to Delete:** CASCADE constraints ensure complete removal
- ✅ **Data Minimization:** Only necessary fields collected
- ✅ **Access Control:** RLS enforces need-to-know

### Security Best Practices
- ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege:** Implemented via RLS
- ✅ **Defense in Depth:** Multiple validation layers
- ✅ **Fail Secure:** Default deny with explicit allow
- ✅ **Separation of Duties:** User vs admin role separation
