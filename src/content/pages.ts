    "Welcome to Sistahology.com, the place <span class=\"text-sistah-pink font-semibold\"><em>just for women</em></span> where we can be ourselves and experience the true essence of who we are and who we are becoming. My purpose in creating this space was to offer women a <span class=\"text-sistah-pink font-semibold\"><strong>FREE online journaling platform</strong></span> where we can be ourselves, a place where we can empty our thoughts, talk out loud, say things we'd dare not say in public.",
    "Written expression gives me permission to be patient with myself, to slow down and reflect on lessons learned and unlearned, to forgive and forget what I have encountered through my experiences. The beautiful truth about digital journaling (and journaling online) is that we can simply <span class=\"text-sistah-pink font-semibold\"><em>enjoy the journey.</em></span>",
    "My goal in this space is that women are allowed to just <span class=\"text-sistah-pink font-semibold\"><strong>BE</strong></span>. To create and just express and explore ourselves and exercise our right to write or draw, or paint or design, to do whatever it takes to be healthy and whole.",
    "So, welcome to your space. Welcome to reflecting online and journaling where you feel that, once again, <span class=\"text-sistah-pink font-semibold\"><em>it's not about the destination, but the journey.</em></span>"
